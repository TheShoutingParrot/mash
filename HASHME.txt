This is a text file that exists just to check if the hash algorithm works.

You can hash this program by running the following commands:

cat HASHME.txt | ./mash - 

You can find the correct output in the README.md file under the "Testing the program" (sub)section.

If the hash that is found there is different to your hash please open an issue on github or email me (theshoutingparrot@protonmail.com).
